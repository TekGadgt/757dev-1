The vision I had for 757dev.org was a simple and beautiful splash page that served a few purposes that solve problems that keep coming up (in order of importance):

1. slack invite. even though anyone can invite, often people just want to request invite.
2. post our code of conduct to help keep it awesome for everyone.
3. For a newcomer, answer the question "what dev/design events are going on in HR". Weekly I run into someone in the local tech industry that doesn't know about us and doesn't realize how awesome and organized we are. I then end up in a mess of "go to this to get slack, then so search this on meetup, then go to revconf... etc". I really just want to say "goto 757dev.org"
4. provide a overview/list/links of major yearly events... nodebots, revconf, devfest, Code Across (Code4HR), etc.
5. logo for 757dev. everything needs a logo.
6. eventually, once we've got other things refined, it would be great to have a curated calendar of all related meetups and events on the page with rss feed or something. But that's a harder problem to solve and not as important as other goals.
